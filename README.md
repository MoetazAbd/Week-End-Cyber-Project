: This project involves creating a tool to attempt to "crack" or find passwords by generating possible password combinations and testing them. The tool can employ two main techniques:

Brute Force Attack: Tries every possible combination of characters up to a certain length until it finds a match.
Dictionary Attack: Uses a list of common passwords (a dictionary) to try each one against the hashed password or plain text password.
The tool will simulate attempts to gain unauthorized access, which is a common method hackers use, but here itâ€™s done in an ethical context to understand how password security works and the limitations of weak passwords.
